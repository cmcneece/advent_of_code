Advent of Code 2022

My partner and I are working on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) this year to practice and have a fun activity to do together. Advent of Code is a daily Christmas theme coding puzzle.

Check out [this sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) for more solutions.

## Daily Log

- *Day 1*: Its been 2 years since I wrote any code. Getting the env set up and fixing all my git mistakes was definitely the hardest part
- *Day 2*: After thinking I would use match-case to code the strategy I quickly remembered that dictionaries are the solution to every problem
- *Day 3*: Ok, maybe sets are the solution to every problem. Was maybe thinking I might code up a solution for arbitrary number of intersecting item in arbitrary groups but decided my life isn't only about AoC
- *Day 4*: feeling very grateful for part 2s that are easier than part 1s. Trying to improve my code documentation as well
- *Day 5*: My partner hard coded the input and saved an hour of her life. I did not. Used deque for the first time. And had to implement some tests to make sure I wasn't going to miss out on any points
- *Day 6*: Some relief thank goodness. Starting to implement type hinting
